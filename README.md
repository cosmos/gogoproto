# Protocol Buffers for Go with Gadgets

Cosmos's fork of [gogo/protobuf](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf).

This code generation is used to achieve:

- fast marshalling and unmarshalling
- more canonical Go structures
- goprotobuf compatibility
- less typing by optionally generating extra helper code
- peace of mind by optionally generating test and benchmark code
- other serialization formats
